## Global Architecture

{{< figure library="true" src="archive-1.0/docs-overview/Keyple-components.svg" title="Global Architecture of Eclipse Keyple™" >}}

Eclipse Keyple™ is currently divided in two major layers:
- The ‘Keyple Core' : a smart card API which allows managing smart card readers in a generic way, whaterver the reader driver or environment, and for standalone or distributed solution.
- A ‘Calypso Keyple extension' : a high level Calypso Processing API allowing to operate commands with a Calypso Portable Object, and to manage a secure Calypso transaction.

Dedicated reader’s plugins have to be implemented in order to interface the Plugin API with the specific reader’s drivers.
