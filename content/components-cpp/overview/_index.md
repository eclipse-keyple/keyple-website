{{% callout note %}} Keyple C++ 2.0 is being validated and is about to be released. 

In the meantime, you can check the list of repositories concerned here: [project dashboard]({{< relref "/project-dashboard" >}}).

Don't worry about the number of repositories, the [keyple-cpp-meta](https://github.com/eclipse/keyple-cpp-meta) repository allows you to create a ready-to-use environment very easily by automatically retrieving all the repositories.

As for the documentation, it is also coming but in the meantime the Java guides and tutorials are applicable as they are except for the programming language aspects.
