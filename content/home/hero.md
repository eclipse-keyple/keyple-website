**_"the best middleware for processing smart cards"_**
- This open source solution is compliant with **any terminal** architecture (embedded / distributed), **any card reader** technology (standard / proprietary, local / remote), **any smart card** solution (ticketing, access control etc…).
- But the main advantage of Keyple is that it's **easy to maintain and simple to upgrade and expand**.

Keyple implements the high-level open source APIs of [Eclipse Keypop®](https://keypop.org/) allowing terminal application to operate smart card reader in a universal way.

The first available card extension allows you to benefit from the key features of Calypso® cards: reliability, security and interoperability.
