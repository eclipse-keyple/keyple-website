Coming from a rather closed technical environment, ticketing for transport is essentially based on proprietary solutions provided by manufacturers. 
However, in order for the concept of Mobility as a Service to become a reality, and at a reasonable cost, the ecosystem should, as far as possible, 
rely on open standards, APIs and SDKs as well as Open Source technologies. This openness has already been a reality for several years in the field 
of passenger information and has enabled the explosion of rich and high-quality applications, thanks in particular to Open Data. Today, Eclipse 
Keyple™ is paving the way for ticketing to follow the same path, by making available for free the first fully Open Source API.

Eclipse Keyple™ accelerates the integration and development of ticketing applications by enabling multimodal transport services, public transport 
operators and event organizers to implement ticketing and access control systems based on a common, open and modular base.

Eclipse Keyple™ works with Keyple's extensions. The first available extension allows you to benefit from Calypso®'s main features of reliability, 
security and interoperability.

Eclipse Keyple™ transforms complex contactless ticketing, transportation and event access systems into a simple integration to manage terminal 
readers and portals that use smart cards and mobile applications to enter and exit.

As an open source technology, Eclipse Keyple™ offers uniformity of structure but does not lock you into a specific ticketing system. Plugins and 
extensions are being created, or may be created by developers, to allow ticket processing integrating technologies other than Calypso®, based on 
several programming languages.
