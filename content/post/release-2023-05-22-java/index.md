Published on May 22, 2023, this minor version implements the
[Calypsonet Terminal Reader Java API (1.3.0)](https://terminal-api.calypsonet.org/archives/apis/calypsonet-terminal-reader-api/)
and therefore introduced a new capability to export a locally processed card selection scenario to be imported and 
analyzed remotely by another card selection manager.

For this purpose, the following two methods have been added to the `CardSelectionManager` interface:
- `exportProcessedCardSelectionScenario`
- `importProcessedCardSelectionScenario`.
