The [release 1.0.0 of Eclipse Keyple™ Java](https://github.com/eclipse/keyple-java/releases/tag/1.0.0) is available.

Most of the improvements concerns the Keyple Core:
- the new Core extension to manage "distributed architecture" and operate remote smart card readers,
- some packages & classes renaming to facilitate the understanding,
- the setting of smart card reader has also been simplified.
The NFC & OMAPI Android plugins have been optimized for all Android versions from 4.4.

A new [Keyple website](https://keyple.org/) provides the documentation and guides to handle the Keyple solution.
