We are pleased to announce that the version 0.9.0 of the Java implementation of Eclipse Keyple™ was released September 11th, 2020.

The main improvement on the Calypso® extension is the addition of high-level API to manage the portable object response. 
Now the APDU responses of the Calypso® cards are automatically parsed to fill card images.
Currently all the components of Eclipse Keyple™ Java are following the same versioning.

From the version 1.0.0 scheduled for November 2020, the components will be defined with their own versioning in order to stabilize as possible the different APIs.

[Documentation]({{< ref "/docs-1.0/" >}}) currently available:
* the project plan,
* the guides of the different public API,
* and a guide to manage the migration between the release 0.8.1 & 0.9.0.
