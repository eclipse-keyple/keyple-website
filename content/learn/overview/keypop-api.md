Keyple is compliant with the **Terminal API** specifications provided by the [Calypso Networks Association](https://calypsonet.org) that standardize how to manage cards, readers, reader events and card selection.

This compliance allows Keyple to obtain certifications from the Calypso Networks Association.
It is a guarantee of reliability and reproducibility of the processes implemented on a variety of devices.

The open source [Eclipse Keypop](https://keypop.org) project exposes the **Terminal API** specifications in the form of
**Java** and **C++** interfaces,
and Keyple is based on these interfaces.

Keyple also defines additional public interface for plugin integration, remote reader management, etc.
