Keyple is composed of multiple components, each designed to support a specific level of integration. These components
are released under different open-source licenses, depending on their intended usage and level of contribution expected
from the community.

<br>

## LIBRARIES
All Keyple libraries are published under the [Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/),
offering strong copyleft protection.
> Any modification of a Keyple library by the community must be re-shared with the [Eclipse Keyple project](https://keyple.org/).

<br>

## APIs
All Keyples APIs are released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), to offer maximum
permissibility for the design of Keyple extensions.
> A Keyple extension can be defined with any open or closed license.

<br>

## EXAMPLES
To facilitate user handling of Keyple middleware, the project offers a multitude of implementation examples published
under the permissive [Eclipse Distribution License 1.0](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/edl-v10.php) (equivalent
to [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause)).
> Users are free to draw inspiration from the examples to create their own solutions without obligation to contribute back.
