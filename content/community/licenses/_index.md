## Keyple 'library' components
All Keyple libraries are published under the [Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/), offering strong copyleft protection.
- Any modification of a Keyple library by the community must be re-shared with the [Eclipse Keyple project](https://keyple.org/).

## Keyple 'API' components
All Keyples APIs are released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), to offer maximum permissibility for the design of Keyple extensions.
- A Keyple extension can be defined with any open or closed license.

## 'Examples' of Keyple middleware implementations
To facilitate user handling of Keyple middleware, the project offers a multitude of implementation examples published under the permissive [Eclipse Distribution License 1.0](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/edl-v10.php) (equivalent to [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause)).
- This means that users can freely draw inspiration from the examples to design their own solutions, without the need for restitution..
