## Current work 
 - Java implementation
   - Refactoring of the Calypso API to support extensions of different kind of Calypso SAM solutions (current legacy SAM-C1, coming Open-SAM, or crypto libraries for PKI).
   - Support of the Calypso secure session based on asymmetric authentication (REV3.3 Prime PKI based on ECC).
 - C++ implementation
   - Porting current components updated with Keypop APIs.
   - Next addition of distributed mode support for building a Keyple Distributed C++ client (interacting with a Keyple Distributed Java server).

## Long-term study 
 - to provide a Hoplink extension (based on a high-level API on top of the Calypso Card API).
 - looking to migrate the Java implementation in Kotlin Multiplatform in order to handle iOS & some native target for ticketing application based on a generic code compliant with Java environment.

### Global evolutions of Keyple until version 2.0.0 <mark>(obsolete)</mark>
Until the version 2.0.0 of Keyple, the components of Keyple Java or Keyple C++ were released at the same time with the same version number.
The porting in C++ of Keyple Java is based on the same Object-Oriented Model. The Keyple C++ implementation provides the same core & Calypso feature, but the support of the distributed module isn't part of the scope, and for reader integration, only the PC/SC reader is provided.

   <td><ul><li><b>Calypso terminal compliance</b>
   <ul><li>The <a href="https://keyple.org/components/core/keyple-service-lib/">Keyple Service</a> component implements the <a href="https://terminal-api.calypsonet.org/archives/apis/calypsonet-terminal-reader-api/">Reader API 1.0</a> and <a href="https://terminal-api.calypsonet.org/apis/calypsonet-terminal-card-api/">Card API 1.0</a> standardized for the reader layer of Calypso terminals. The implementation is compliant with the <a href="https://calypsonet.org/calypso-for-terminals/">reader layer requirements</a> for Calypso terminals</li>
   <li>The <a href="https://keyple.org/components/card-extensions/keyple-card-calypso-lib/">Calypso card extension</a> library in version 2.0.0 follows also the <a href="https://calypsonet.org/calypso-for-terminals/">Calypso layer requirements</a> defined for Calypso terminals, it implements the <a href="https://terminal-api.calypsonet.org/archives/apis/calypsonet-terminal-calypso-api/">Calypso API 1.0</a>.</li></ul>
    <li><b>Removal of dependencies</b> between Keyple components (Core, Calypso extension, and specific plugins): all components are released with their own version number and could evolve separately.
     <ul><li>Until the version 1.0.0, the source code of all the Keyple Java components was hosted in a single repository: <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-java">https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-java</a>. It was the same for Keyple C++ components hosted in <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-cpp">https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-cpp</a>. For the version 1.0.0 and below, there were strong dependencies between the Keyple components which had all to be released in the same version number.</li>
<li>To facilitate the evolution and the maintenance, the version 2.0.0 proposes a full reorganization of the code. All the components are split in different repositories in order to allow them to evolve independently. The public interfaces are also separated to the specific implementations: the repositories are dedicated to host API or library implementation.</li>
<li>The Keyple Java components are managed through <a href="https://keyple.org/project-dashboard/">16 repositories</a>.</li>
     </li></ul>
     <li>The API for plugin implementation and for distributed architecture configuration have been simplified</li></ul></td>
