## Overview

The Eclipse Keyple solution provides currently 2 modules:
 - the **Keyple Core**, a universal smart card reader interface to manage the setting of smart card reader, the detection and the communication with smart card, and the selection of card application.
 - the **Keyple Calypso**, a first smart card solution extension built on the Keyple Core, dedicated to manage Calypso processing, Calypso card identification, card command generation, card data recovery, authentication with the secure session.

The Keyple Core provides 3 interfaces:
 - the **Service API**, to allow terminal application to handle reader & select card
 - the **Card API**, for APDU command transmission, card data parsing
 - the **Plugin API**, to integrate specific smart card reader solutions.

The Keyple Calypso extension provides the Calypso API: a high-level interface to manage Calypso card processing.

## Application integration

The Card API is a low-level interface to manage the transmission of APDU commands with a smart card.
A terminal application operating processing with a specific smart card solution could be implemented directly on top the Card API.

Another way offering a better abstraction on smart card technical settings could be to implement on the Card API a smart card solution library extension providing a high level interface: a specific Solution API.
This is how the Keyple Calypso extension has be defined, the Calypso API is a high level functional interface, which hides the low-level APDU operations.

## Reader integration

### native integration

The smart card readers could be directly integrated with the Keyple Core. By interfacing through the Plugin API, a specific plugin dedicated to a smart card reader solution, the Keyple Core could have the capability to fully manage the smart card readers corresponding to this native plugin.

The Eclipse Keyple project provides the plugin for the main standard smart card reader solutions.

 - The PC/SC plugin is available for both the Java and the C++ implementation of Eclipse Keyple, it allows to interface PC/SC reader on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
 - For Android devices the NFC plugin allows to operate the standard NFC interface to handle external contactless smart card. And the OMAPI plugin provides the integration of internal eSE (embedded Secure Element) or UICC (SIM card). Both plugins support Keyple Java.
 - The Remote plugin (part of the Core distributed extension) allows to operate remote smart card readers.

### hybrid integration

It's also possible to integrate Keyple in a terminal solution already embedding not Keyple based terminal applications operating smart card solutions. In those kinds of terminal, a Reader Manager has already the direct control on a smart card reader and manage the smart card detection: depending on the type of smart card identified on the reader, a specific terminal application is requested to operated the processing of the smart card.

{{< figure library="true" src="architecture/Keyple_Architecture_Reader_Integration_hybrid.svg" title="Keyple Architecture Hybrid Plugins" >}}

In this case a reader manager plugin, also based on the Plugin API, could allow the Keyple Core to operate the processing of a specific smart card, when requested by the Reader Manager.

For example, an EMV certified reader manager could call a Keyple application in case of PPSE selection failure.

## Smart card processing
### stand-alone
By default, a terminal application manages the processing of a specific smart card in stand-alone with its local readers.

### distributed
The **Distributed** extension of the Keyple Core provides a solution allowing a master terminal application to manage the processing of a smart card localized in a remote driven terminal.

## Smart card transaction
There are two ways for a terminal application to manage a transaction with a smart card.
 - Either the smart card processing could be directly started by the terminal application.
 - Otherwise, the smart card processing could be launched when a smart card is inserted in a reader of the terminal.
 
### explicit selection
For a classic transaction,
 - the presence of a card is firtsly checked on a reader,
 - then the car is selected and identified,
 - finally, a transaction is processed with the card application.

### default selection
 - For automatons (e.g. a ticketing validator), the ticketing transaction is often driven by the insertion of a card.
 - Keyple Core allows to define a default selection on Observable Reader, and in return to be notified of successful selections.
