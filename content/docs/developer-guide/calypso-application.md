## Overview

Keyple API was designed to support an extension system. On top of **Keyple Core**, APIs can be developed to extend
Keyple features. For example, Calypso Network Association provides **Keyple Calypso Extension**. 

The use of **Keyple Calypso Extension** open the ability to operate commands with a calypso Portable Object and to manage a 
secure calypso transaction.

The diagram below shows the role of the **Keyple Calypso Extension** components in the software layers for a standalone application :

## Concepts
Here are the main concepts to keep in mind before continuing to read this developer guide :

### Calypso PO
Concentrate all known informations about the Personal Object being processed. Accessible informations are
* The application identification fields (revision/version, class, DF name, serial number, ATR, issuer)
* The indication of the presence of optional features (Stored Value, PIN, Rev3.2 mode, ratification management)
* The management information of the modification buffer
* The invalidation status
* The files, counters, SV data read or modified during the execution of the processes defined  by PoTransaction

Calypso PO fields are populated from a CardSelectionResponse obtained through the process of a PO selection.

```java
    ...
    //Retrieve PO's informations
    String atr = calypsoPo.getAtr()
    byte[] applicationSerial+Number = calypsoPo.getApplicationSerialNumber()
    //SFI_EventLog = 0x08
    ElementaryFile efEventLog = calypsoPo.getFileBySfi(SFI_EventLog);
    //SFI_EnvironmentAndHolder = 0x07
    ElementaryFile efEnvironmentAndHolder =calypsoPo.getFileBySfi(SFI_EnvironmentAndHolder);
    ...
```

### ElementaryFile
Object containing the description of a Calypso Elementary File. Can be retrieved from Calypso PO using its SFI. 

```java
    ...
    ElementaryFile efEventLog = calypsoPo.getFileBySfi(SFI_EventLog);
    //Read data content of sevent log elemenatary file
    String eventLog = ByteArrayUtil.toHex(efEventLog.getData().getContent());
    ...
```
### PoSelection

Service extending Keyple Core Abstract Card Selection to manage specific features of Calypso POs during the selection:
* Send APDU Commands to the POs right after the card selection.
* Produce a Calypso PO from the CardSelectionResponse. The object is filled with the PO identification data from the FCI and the
possible responses to additional APDU commands executed after the selection.

```java
    ...
    // Prepare a Calypso PO selection
    CardSelectionsService cardSelectionsService = new CardSelectionsService();

    // Setting of an AID based selection of a Calypso REV3 PO
    // Select the first application matching the selection AID whatever the card communication
    // protocol keep the logical channel open after the selection

    // Calypso selection: configures a PoSelection with all the desired attributes to
    // make the selection and read additional information afterwards
    PoSelection poSelection =
        new PoSelection(
            PoSelector.builder()
                .cardProtocol(ContactlessCardCommonProtocols.ISO_14443_4.name())
                .aidSelector(
                    CardSelector.AidSelector.builder().aidToSelect(CalypsoClassicInfo.AID).build())
                .invalidatedPo(PoSelector.InvalidatedPo.REJECT)
                .build());

    // Prepare the reading order.
    poSelection.prepareReadRecordFile(
        CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_EnvironmentAndHolder, CalypsoClassicInfo.RECORD_NUMBER_1);

    // Add the selection case to the current selection (we could have added other cases
    // here)
    cardSelectionsService.prepareSelection(poSelection);
    CalypsoPo calypsoPo = (CalypsoPo) cardSelectionsService.processExplicitSelections(poReader).getActiveSmartCard();
    ...
```

### Calypso SAM
Concentrates all the informations we know about the SAM currently selected. Accessible informations are:
 * The Sam Revision
 * The Serial number
 * The Platform identifier
 * The Application Type
 * The Application SubType
 * The Software Issuer identifier
 * The Software Version number
 * The Software Revision number

Calypso SAM fields are populated by analysis of the ATR within a CardSelectionResponse obtained through the process of a SAM selection.

```java
    ...
    byte[] serialNumber = calypsoSam.getSerialNumber()
    ...
```

### SamSelection
Service extending Keyple Core Abstract Card Selection specialized to manage the specific characteristics of Calypso SAMs. 
The service provides an instance of Calypso SAM and may execute the unlock command during the selection process.

```java
    ...
    CardSelectionsService samSelection = new CardSelectionsService();

    //Sam selection parameters
    SamSelector samSelector = SamSelector.builder().samRevision(SamRevision.C1).serialNumber(".*").build();
    samSelection.prepareSelection(new SamSelection(samSelector));

    //Sam reader retrieved from registered plugin
    CardSelectionsResult cardSelectionsResult = samSelection.processExplicitSelections(samReader);
    if (!cardSelectionsResult.hasActiveSelection()) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to open a logical channel for SAM!");
    }

    //Cast selected card to CalypsoSam
    CalypsoSam calypsoSam = (CalypsoSam) cardSelectionsResult.getActiveSmartCard();
    ...
```

### PoSecuritySettings
Concentrate the security settings involved in Calypso Secure Sessions:
* A reference to the Sam resource
* The default KIF  
* The default KVC
* The default Key Record Number
* The modification mode
* The ratification mode
* The pin transmission mode
* The default Pin Ciphering Key
* The SV Get Log Reade mode
* the SV Negative balance

 The fields are populated with default values when the object is instantiated but can be customized to adjust the settings
 to the application needs.
 
```java
    // Security settings
    // Both Reload and Debit SV logs are requested
    PoSecuritySettings poSecuritySettings =
        new PoSecuritySettings.PoSecuritySettingsBuilder(samResource)
            .svGetLogReadMode(SvSettings.LogRead.ALL)
            .build();
```

### SAM Resource Managers
Services providing methods to allocate/deallocate SAM resources. Keyple Calypso API provides 3 type of managers: Default, 
Factory, Pool. The choice of the manager to use depends on the abilities of the plugin used for the SAM connexion.

### PoTransaction
Service providing high-level API to manage transactions with a Calypso PO. The tied Calypso PO Object  is kept and updated at
each step of using this service. 

This service workflow is composed of two steps:
* Prepare the commands to be executed to the PO
* Process the prepared commands. Regarding of commands, the presence of SAM could be mandatory.

```java
    ...
    CardResource<CalypsoPo> poResource = new CardResource<CalypsoPo>(poReader, calypsoPo);
    
    PoTransaction poTransaction = new PoTransaction(poResource, poSecuritySettings);

    // Read the EventLog file at the Session Opening
    poTransaction.prepareReadRecordFile(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_EventLog, CalypsoClassicInfo.RECORD_NUMBER_1);

    // Open a secure session (DEBIT level) and execute the prepared command
    poTransaction.processOpening(PoTransaction.SessionSetting.AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_DEBIT);

    // Get and display the EventLog data
    ElementaryFile efEventLog = calypsoPo.getFileBySfi(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_EventLog);

    String eventLog = ByteArrayUtil.toHex(efEventLog.getData().getContent());

    // Prepare a SV Debit (this command could also have been placed before processOpening
    // since it is not followed by any other command)
    poTransaction.prepareSvGet(SvSettings.Operation.DEBIT, SvSettings.Action.DO);

    // Execute the prepared command
    poTransaction.processPoCommands();

    //Get updated sv balance
    int svBalance = calypsoPo.getSvBalance()

    //Get the updated SV last transaction number
    int svLastTNum = calypsoPo.getSvLastTNum()
    ...
```
