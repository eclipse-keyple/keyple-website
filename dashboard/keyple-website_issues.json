    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nSpringCard is happy to contribute to the Keyple project by providing a plugin that makes it possible to use SpringCard PC/SC couplers from a stock Android tablet or mobile phone.\r\n\r\nThe plugin works\r\n\r\n- with all SpringCard PC/SC over USB devices.\r\n\r\nThis includes all the SpringCard Puck family (for instance SpringCard Puck One, featuring contactless+SAM: https://www.springcard.com/en/products/puck-one), SpringCard Prox'N'Roll (https://www.springcard.com/en/products/proxnroll-pcsc-hsp) and virtually all PC/SC over USB (CCID) devices.\r\n\r\nThe Android host must be a complete USB host (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/usb/host). USB on-the-go (OTG) is not enough!\r\nPay attention that the Android host must also be able to provide enough power to the reader (more than 250mA), which is not the case for many tablets and mobile phones. Using a USB 3 hub with power delivery is generally the solution.\r\n\r\n- with SpringCard PC/SC over BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices.\r\n\r\nFirst BLE PC/SC reader in SpringCard's portfolio is SpringCard Puck Blue (https://www.springcard.com/en/products/puck-blue). Other devices will be introduced in the future. The Android host must support BLE (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/ble-overview).\r\n\r\nThe plugin is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/springcard/android-keyple\r\n\r\nIt is based on SpringCard's PC/SC-Like for Android libraries (https://github.com/springcard/android-pcsclike) that connects to the reader in BLE or USB using only 'user-land' methods.\r\n\r\nFeel free to communicate about this plugin in Keyple materials, and to integrate it in demo applications.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJohann\r\nSpringCard",
