### C++ Implementation Notes

#### Versioning

The Keyple C++ implementation is a transposition of the Java version. As a result, the C++ version may lag
behind the Java version by one or more release cycles.

To make version correspondence explicit:

- The **Java implementation** follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer) with **three digits**:<br>
  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- The **C++ implementation** uses **four digits**:<br>
  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.CPP_FIX`

In this scheme, the first three digits of the C++ version reflect the corresponding Java source version, while
the fourth digit represents any C++-specific fixes or adjustments.

#### UML Class Diagrams

The class structure of the C++ implementation is directly inspired by the UML class diagrams of
the Java version, ensuring conceptual and architectural consistency between both languages.

#### User Guides

The user guides mainly provide Java code snippets, but the same concepts and logic are directly transposable to
the C++ implementation.
