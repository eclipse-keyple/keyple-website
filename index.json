For example, a smart card reader could be a terminal, a portable scanning laser gun, or a swipe tablet area that is embedded into a door, vehicle or gate. Code is written for a terminal to set the parameters for allowing cards or apps to transmit ticketing information data. Sometimes in a distributed architecture system design, the code for the reader is not on the terminal, but in a cloud environment, so the reader sends the data to cloud-based architecture. Ticketing application: This is behind-the-scenes code that is able to take the data from the smart card reader and, in milliseconds real-time, analyze the balance of the ticket, confirm the permissions for entry, and update the data on the ticket (for example, to confirm that the ticket holder can enter the gate or vehicle, and then to deduct the cost of the journey and calculate the new balance).  According to this scheme, Keyple™ defines two layers:\n Smart Card readers are integrated through plugins implementing the SE Proxy API which manages the communications with a smart card through any type of contactless or contact reader (local, remote, standard, proprietary…) Ticketing applications relies on a high-level Calypso® processing API to manage Calypso® commands \u0026amp; security features. This API uses the SE Proxy API to communicate with the reader  Keyple™ comes with dedicated plugins that integrate directly with smart card readers that have been built on standard software interfaces including PC/SC, Android NFC reader, and Android OMAPI.\nIn cases where there is a distributed architecture design, Keyple™ includes a Remote API plugin so that a smart card terminal can be operated remotely, as if it were local to the terminal, and ensures that robust security and speed is not sacrificed in a cloud-based system.\nThe Calypso Processing API is also available as a Keyple™ extension. This component carries out the terminal processing element of ticketing technology. Access to Calypso’s security features are automatically managed by the Keyple™ extension.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603811078,"objectID":"bf786b8ea9088ea228a979a08534bfca","permalink":"/keyple-website/what-is-keyple/main-features/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/what-is-keyple/main-features/","section":"what-is-keyple","summary":"Keyple makes contactless ticketing accessible.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple's main features","type":"what-is-keyple"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Calypso® is a set of specifications describing a fast and secure off-line contactless transaction, between a portable object and a terminal.

Several solutions can be considered:\n When installing git for Windows, an option Enable symbolic links can be choosen. If it has not been enabled and you want to set it via the installer, a reinstallation is needed If you do not want to reinstall git, this option can be enabled afterward via the command line git config core.symlinks true Also, the option can be enabled once only for this specific cloning operation with git clone -c core.symlinks=true REPO_URL  It is important to note that for this option to be actually working, the Windows user needs to have the SeCreateSymbolicLink permission: a user with admin rights is typically granted with this permission.\nImport keyple components with Gradle When using gradle, it is fairly simple to import Keyple components into your project.

Otherwise if the reader is “observable”, the operating of a “default selection”: in this case a default selection request is defined on the reader, the terminal observes the reader, and wait to be notified by the reader about a SE insertion and selection.  At the end the terminal gets a selected SE, it can follow by operating APDU commands with the selected SE until the communication channel is kept open.\nThen a Keyple Core extension could be used to operates APDU commands with the selected SE solution.\n The Keyple Calypso extension provides a high-level API to defined ticketing processing involving Calypso cards, cf.: “Keyple Calypso User Guide”.\n Secure Element Proxy Service API – readers management Using the Keyple Core, Secure Element Readers (SeReader) are managed through plugins (ReaderPlugin).\nThe active plugins are registered to the SE Proxy Service (the singleton SeProxyService).\n Each plugin is registered through a unique name to the SE Proxy Service. Each reader of a plugin is also defined with a unique name inside the plugin.  Plugin setting To secure the usage of the SE Proxy API for the development of terminal applications, the internal implementation of plugins (classes SpecificPluginImpl \u0026amp; SpecificReaderImpl) is hidden.\n For a specific plugin, only the plugin \u0026amp; reader interfaces (SpecificPlugin \u0026amp; SpecificReader) and the factory (class SpecificPluginFactory) are public. The factory of a plugin is set to register a specific plugin to the SE Proxy Service.  Most of plugins of local readers of Keyple are defined as singleton with a unique instance (e.g.: PC/SC, Android NFC, Android OMAPI, most of embedded readers).\nFor the Remote SE plugin defined to manage remote readers, specific plugin instances are created for each communication interfaces.\nSE readers’ access The SE Proxy Service allows to get all the list of the active plugins. A specific plugin could also be directly recovered through its name.\nIn the same way, a plugin can provide the list of all the plugged readers.\nDepending on the native reader technology, some specific parameters could be defined at the plugin or reader level.\nFor a classic plugin, the number of readers is determinate, all the plugged readers of the plugin are directly available for the SE Proxy Service.\nSupport of reader farm or HSM For systems based on a centralized security, in order to manage multiple remote terminal in parallel, central servers could requires to interface a huge number (several hundreds or thousands) of SE through a farm of readers or HSM (Hardware Security Module: an electronic board able to emulate multiple SE).\n The multitude of embedded SE could be divided in different groups of profiles. An HSM is often shared between several services, so the full set of readers isn\u0026rsquo;t directly available for a service, a service has to request the allocation of a reader from a specific group.  The SE Proxy Service could support reader farm or HSM though plugins managing \u0026ldquo;pool\u0026rdquo; of readers (ReaderPoolPlugin).\n At the initialization, the list of reader is empty. The list is be filled depending on the reader allocations requested. When not more required, a reader could be released from the pool.  All plugins have to implement the interface ReaderPlugin and SeReader. A plugin managing a pool of reader should implement in addition the interface ReaderPoolPlugin.\nSE presence check \u0026amp; “explicit selection transaction” A SE reader has the capability to check is a SE is present or not.\n For SE terminal processing for which the presence of a SE in a reader is \u0026ldquo;static' during a transaction, the transaction starts in general with the verification of the SE presence. If the SE is present, the transaction can continue with the selection of the SE. We call this kind of transaction: an \u0026ldquo;explicit selection transaction\u0026rdquo;.\n Plugin \u0026amp; Reader events For some SE terminal, the processing is dynamically driven by the insertion/remove of a SE in a reader, or by the plug/unplug of a reader.\nE.g., in transportation, the ticketing transaction of access control gates is often started when a contactless card is detected in the field of the reader. For that, in Keyple, a SE reader or a plugin has to be observable.\nA plugin could be optionally observable (by implementing ObservablePlugin).\n In this case a terminal application could observe the plugin (by implementing PluginObserver) in order to be notified (PluginEvent) when a new reader is plugged to the plugin, or when a referenced reader is unplugged. To receive the notification of a specific plugin, the plugin observer should first be added to the observer list of the observable plugin.  Depending on the capability of the plugin, a reader could be optionally observable (by implementing ObservableReader).\n A terminal application could observe the plugin (by implementing ReaderObserver) in order to be notified (ReaderEvent) when a SE is inserted or removed from a specific. The reader observer should be added to the observer list to receive the notifications the observable reader.  By default, an observable reader notifies only the insertion or the remove of a SE.\nPlugin observability activation An observable plugin automatically starts to observe plugin events when at least one plugin observer is registered and stops the listening when the last plugin observer is removed.\nAutomatic selection \u0026amp; “default selection transaction” On an observable reader, there is in addition the possibility to define a \u0026ldquo;default selection operation\u0026rdquo;: in this case, when a SE is inserted, the observable reader tries automatically to select the inserted SE using the defined default setting.\n If the inserted SE is successfully selected, then the observable reader notifies that \u0026ldquo;an inserted SE has matched the default selection\u0026rdquo; and provides the corresponding response. Otherwise if the observable reader failed to select the inserted SE, it could just notify that a SE has been inserted.   For SE terminal for which the processing is \u0026ldquo;dynamically\u0026rdquo; driven by the presence of a SE in a reader, the transaction starts in general with the detection of the insertion of a SE and its automatic selection. The reader observer is then notified to analyze the response of the selected SE, and to continue the transaction with the SE. We call this kind of transaction: a \u0026ldquo;default selection transaction\u0026rdquo;.\n Reader notification modes If no default selection is defined, an observable reader notifies its observers for “SE insertion” (whatever the SE detected) or “SE removed” events. A default selection could be defined for the “always” or the \u0026ldquo;matched only” notification mode.\n In the always mode, if the inserted matches the default selection, the observers are notified about a “SE matched” event, otherwise an “SE insertion” event is notified. In case of \u0026ldquo;matched only” mode, the observable reader doesn’t notify SE insertion event. The reader observer will be notified only if a default selection succeed on the observable reader; this configuration allows the reader observer to skip the processing of wrong SE insertions.  Reader observability activation, “polling mode” \u0026amp; “SE removal procedure” For an observable reader, the listening of reader event requires also the registration of at least one reader observer.\nAn observable reader could switch between four internal states: “Wait for start detection”, “Wait for SE insertion”, “Wait for SE processing”, “Wait for SE removal”.\n At the wait for start detection, the observable reader doesn’t notify any event. The start of the SE detection by an observable reader need to be explicitly requested by an observer by setting a “polling mode” either through a ‘startSeDetection’ or a ‘setDefaultSelectionRequest’ commands. The SE detection could be started for polling mode defined either in “single shot” or “repeating” mode.  In single shot mode, the observable reader stops the detection after the SE removal (back to the wait for start detection). In repeating mode, after the SE removal, the observable reader restart to detect another SE (back to the wait for SE insertion).   Wait for SE insertion, if a SE is inserted or selected, the registered reader observers are notified by the observable reader according to the defined notification mode. The observable reader switches to the wait for SE processing. During the SE processing by the observers, the observable reader waits that an observer acknowledges the end of the SE processing. There are two waits to ends the processing of an observed SE:  Either an observer directly could stop the listening of the observable reader (‘stopSeDetection’ command). The observable reader switches to the wait for start detection, and the observers are immediately notified about the SE remove. Otherwise, the observers could wait for a clean remove of the SE from the observable reader; it’s the SE removal sequence:  When the main reader observer has finished the processing of the SE, it could request the observable reader to wait for the remove of the SE (‘notifySeProcessed’ command). Finally, the reader observers could be notified when the SE is effectively removed. If the SE insertion listening started in the \u0026ldquo;repeating polling mode\u0026rdquo;, then when the SE is removed, the observable reader automatically starts again the listening of a new SE insertion; otherwise a new explicit request to start the SE listening is required to restart the listening.      Secure Element Selection API Selection parameters (Communication protocol, ATR, AID) To select a Secure Element, a SE Selector has to be defined, based on one to three parameters.\n A SE selection could be defined for a specific communication protocol. A SE could be filtered for an ATR (Answer To Reset) matching a specific regular expression. A specific application of a SE could be selected by setting its AID (Application IDentifier).  Selection transaction To operate a transaction with a SE, it should be firstly selected. The aim of the SE selection API is to get a SE resource: a set of a reader with a selected SE.\nA SE Selection is managed in two steps:\n first the “preparations” of selection request based on SE selector, next the “processing” of the selection requests.  In order to manage multiple kinds of SE, several selection requests could be prepared with different selectors.\nDepending on the setting of the reader, the processing of the selection could be operated in two different ways:\n either in a “explicit” way after the checking of the SE presence, or in a ”default” way for an observable reader detecting the insertion of a SE.   cf. “Generic Use Case 1 / Explicit AID Selection” example\ncf. “Generic Use Case 2 / Default Selection Notification” example\n In case a SE Selection is prepared with a channel control mode defined as “keep open”, then the different prepared selectors are operated with the presented SE, but the processing of the selection stops when a selector matches the SE.\n The result of the SE selection could be a single ‘matching SE’: this SE is kept as selected in the reader. It’s possible to directly operate command with the SE.  But if a SE selection has been defined with a channel control mode at “close after”, in this case all the prepared SE selectors are operated whatever the matching result.\n After each selector processing, if a selector has matched, the logical channel with the SE is closed (the SE is no more selected). If several applications of the presented SE have matched the selectors: the result of the processing of SE selections is a list matching SE, but all of them are deselected. To continue the SE processing, the terminal application has to choose one matching SE, and to select it again but in “keep open” channel control mode.   cf. “Generic Use Case 3 / Grouped Multi-Selection” example\n After the selection of a SE, using a SE resource, the terminal can continue by operating a specific transaction with the corresponding SE.\n cf. “Generic Use Case 4 / Sequential Multi-Selection” example\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603814711,"objectID":"ab9ddb1d301e4f8e2308e0076ac779a6","permalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture/keyple-core/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture/keyple-core/","section":"docs","summary":"This high-level API is convenient for developers implementing smart card processing application for terminal interfaced with smart card readers.\nPackages \u0026amp; features The Keyple Core User API is a tool to manage readers, and to select “generic” Secure Elements.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple Core Architecture","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Packages \u0026amp; features The Keyple Calypso User API is an extension of the Keyple Core User API to manage Calypso Portable Object securely using Calypso SAM:\n The generic Secure Element selection is enhanced for the selection of a Calypso PO. The FCI response is automatically analyzed in order to identify the revision and the features supported by the Calypso PO. The invalidation status is also checked. The selected Calypso PO object allows to automatically initialize a Calypso PO transaction: high level functional commands could be prepared and processed in order to read or write data in the PO file structure, outside or securely inside a Calypso secure session.    Features Packages   Calypso PO operations Selection of Calypso SE: PO or SAM PO transaction: Read / update of data PO authentication org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.transaction   Calypso PO responses data parsing org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.po.parser   Calypso Selection The Calypso API to select a Portable object is an extension of the generic Secure Element selection Core API:\n A PO AID selection could be defined to accept or reject invalidated PO. A request for a SE selection is defined with SE selector containing at least an AID (to operate through a Select Application APDU command) or an ATR filter. A request for a PO selection could be enhanced to operate after the PO selector processing some APDU commands with the PO : Select File or Read Records commands. In case of successful Calypso PO, the matching SE is retuned as a Calypso PO. The Calypso API analyzes the startup information of a Calypso PO in order to identify the kind of product, its revision, the optional features supported, the file structure used. Then for coming PO commands, the setting of the technical parameters automatically managed.  The PO command grouped with the PO selection have to be “prepared” before the processing of a default or explicit SE selection.\n cf. “Calypso Use Case 1 / Explicit AID Selection” example\ncf. “Calypso Use Case 2 / Default Selection Notification” example\n A ‘PO resource’ is the set of a Calypso PO and the reader on which it is selected.\nIn a same way the Calypso APO provides the tool to select a Calypso security module (a SAM). A SAM selector doesn’t support AID. The corresponding matching SE is a Calypso SAM. A Calypso SAM and the reader used for its selection defines a ‘SAM resource’.\nCalypso secure transaction A PO transaction could be operated on a Calypso resource. In case a SAM resource is set, a PO transaction could support the Calypso secure session in order to manage a mutual authentication between the terminal and the Calypso PO.\nThrough the PO transaction API, only the APDU commands for the PO are explicitly defined; the APDU commands for the SAM are automatically built by the library. Two kinds of methods are provided by the API: ‘prepare’ methods, and ‘process’ methods.\n The ‘prepare’ methods allows to define PO file selection and PO data access operations (read or update of records for a specific file, append of record for a cyclic file, increase or decrease of the value of a counter). A ‘process” method sends to the PO at least the previously prepared command.  The process PO commands method could operated only if no secure session is currently open with the PO. If one or several PO commands have been prepared, a single request is done to the PO reader. The process opening method allows to manage the opening of a secure session.  First a single request is operated to the SAM reader in order to set the PO serial as the cryptographic diversifier, and to get the terminal challenge for the session. Then another single request is done to the PO reader to play the prepared PO command, and to manage the opening of the PO session.   A process PO command in session method could be processed only if a secure session is already open with PO.  A single request Is operated with the PO reader to operate the prepared PO commands. Another single request is sent to the SAM reader to update the update the digest of the MAC session.   The process closing method is used to manage the closing of the secure session with the PO.  A first SAM request is operated to update the digest of the last prepared PO commands and to get the terminal session certificate (to save a PO request, the API anticipates the responses of the prepared PO commands). A single PO request is transmitted to run the last prepared PO command, to recover the PO session certificate, and to send the ratification signal if necessary. Finally, a second SAM request allows to authenticate the PO. If the transaction is successful the mutual authentication is valid, and the PO has atomically committed the requested data updates.      The minimal costs of a Calypso secure session are:\n 3 PO requests (1 for the PO selection + 1 for the PO session opening + 1 for the PO session closing). And 3 SAM requests if the SAM is already selected (1 for the PO session opening + 2 for the PO session closing); otherwise 4 SAM requests if the SAM isn’t already selected.  By default, the PO transaction manages the Calypso secure session as ‘atomic’: the cumulative amount of PO updates command can’t exceed the size of the PO session buffer.\n cf. “Calypso Use Case 4 / PO Authentication” example\n The PO transaction could also be defined to allow multiple sessions: in this case the transaction is automatically split in several session as necessary.\n cf. “Calypso Use Case 5 / PO Multiple Session\u0026quot; example\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603814711,"objectID":"dbd01d0e9390470da13203692a071540","permalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture/keyple-calypso/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture/keyple-calypso/","section":"docs","summary":"Packages \u0026amp; features The Keyple Calypso User API is an extension of the Keyple Core User API to manage Calypso Portable Object securely using Calypso SAM:\n The generic Secure Element selection is enhanced for the selection of a Calypso PO.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple Calypso Architecture","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This getting started contains one ready-to-execute JAVA example starting from a new Gradle project.\nThe example demonstrate Keyple capabilities with the Keyple PCSC plugin and PO/SAM provided in the Calypso Test Kit.\nBuild The example can run on any machine: Linux, Windows and MacOS.

These are the plugins that allow access to the hardware functionality of the terminal by using the native Android SDK or the terminal manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s own custom SDKs.\nThis guide will describe how to start a ticketing application using Keyple SDK and Android NFC plugin to read the content of a Calypso SmartCard. As we want to focus on Keyple integration, the Android application architecture will remain the simplest as possible.\nWhat to we need for this guide?  Retail Device with NFC powered by android.nfc library (integrated into standard Android SDK). Android OS 19+ A NFC SmartCard with Calypso PO  Integration Application setup Like for any other Android NFC Application, we need to declare items in the application manifest.\n\u0026lt;manifest xmlns:android=\u0026quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\u0026quot;\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;uses-permission android:name=\u0026quot;android.permission.NFC\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;uses-feature android:name=\u0026quot;android.hardware.nfc\u0026quot; android:required=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/manifest\u0026gt;  SDK Integration Keyple Core This high-level API is convenient for developers implementing smart card processing application for terminal interfaced with smart card readers.

In pre-requisite, read page Develop a Local Ticketing Application to understand the main concepts of Keyple in a local application. Read chapter Concepts to understand the main terms and concepts of the Keyple Remote Plugin solution. Read the introduction of chapter Remote Plugins to be informed about the different remote plugins and APIs proposed by the solution. Using chapter Use cases, find your use case. This will help you to determine exactly which library and API to use. Using chapter Download, import into your project the libraries specified by your use case. Using chapter Network configuration, implement the transport layer adapted to your network configuration. Implement your ticketing services as specified in the associated use case.  Concepts Here are the main concepts to keep in mind before continuing to read this developer guide :\n   Concept Description     Remote Lib This is the library keyple-java-plugin-remote-remote.\nIt must be imported and used by the application installed on the terminal not having local access to the smart card reader and that wishes to control the reader remotely.   Local Lib This is the library keyple-java-plugin-remote-local.\nIt must be imported and used by the application installed on the terminal having local access to the smart card reader but wishes to delegate all or part of the ticketing processing to a remote application.   Common Lib This is the library keyple-java-plugin-remote-common.\nThis library is implicitly imported by Remote Lib and Local Lib because it contains common elements.   Remote Plugin Part of the Remote Lib, this is a Keyple plugin which provides only Remote Readers to the application. It manages data exchanges with the Local Service. This plugin must be registered to the smart card service like any Keyple plugin.   Remote Reader Part of the Remote Plugin, this is a Keyple reader which has some specificities :\n- each remote reader is connected to a local reader ;\n- any command sent by the application to a remote reader will be forwarded to the associated local reader ;\n- any event occurs on a local reader or plugin will be forwarded to the associated remote reader or plugin.   Local Service Part of the Local Lib, this service ensures data exchange between the Remote Plugin and local plugins and readers. It must be initialized and started by the host application.   Factory Remote Plugin and Local Service each have a specific factory class to initialize them.   Utility Remote Plugin and Local Service each have a specific utility class to access them everywhere in the code.   Node Remote Plugin and Local Service each are bind to a specific internal node which is responsible for the interfacing with the Network Endpoint.   Network Endpoint At the user\u0026rsquo;s charge, this component ensures the network exchanges between the Remote Plugin and Local Service nodes.      #concepts-table-1 table th:first-of-type { width: 130px; }  The diagram below illustrates the main functional concepts through a standard use case :\n  The second diagram below illustrates an arbitrary more complex possible use case with several hardware readers connected to different terminals.\nThese could be for example a ticketing reloading service, where the intelligence would be on the terminal with remote readers, with thin clients on A \u0026amp; B terminals communicating locally with the cards.\nIn this use case, the Remote Plugin is used for card communication.\n  Here is another example, but this time it illustrates several Remote Plugins connected to the same Local Service.\nThese could be for example ticketing terminals with transaction logic, which communicate locally with cards, but which do not have SAM, and which use a SAM server with hardware reader.\nIn this use case, the Remote Plugin is used for SAM communication.\n  Remote Plugins The Keyple Remote Plugin solution provides 3 different specific Remote Plugin components, each one having a specific API described in chapter Remote Plugins APIs designed on a Client-Server model in which the Client is always the initiator of the communication :\n   Plugin Description      RemotePluginServer Allows a server application to control a smart card reader available on a client (e.g. PO reader).    RemotePluginClient or\nObservableRemotePluginClient Allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader).    PoolRemotePluginClient Allows a client application to control a pool of smart cards readers available on a server (e.g. HSM readers).      #plugins-table-1 table th:first-of-type { width: 220px; }  Moreover, some plugins have different modes in which they allow or not the observation of plugin or reader events (such as smart card insertion, reader connection, etc\u0026hellip;).\nEach Remote Plugin and Local Service has a default name, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible to specify a custom name during the initialization phase.\nIt is thus possible to have within an application as many instances of a specific Remote Plugin or Local Service as desired.\nRemotePluginServer This plugin allows a server application to control a smart card reader available on a client (e.g. PO reader).\n   API Client Server     Library Local Lib Remote Lib   Remote Plugin / Local Service LocalServiceClient RemotePluginServer   Factory LocalServiceClientFactory RemotePluginServerFactory   Utility LocalServiceClientUtils RemotePluginServerUtils    USE AND SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS  Server side :  configure the factory by providing the network and plugin observer implementation. Please note that this plugin is observable only to trigger ticketing services on the server side, but does not allow observation on the local plugin (reader insertion, etc\u0026hellip;), register the Remote Plugin to the smart card service using the factory, await for events of type PluginEvent.READER_CONNECTED, when an event occurs, get the specified remote reader from the Remote Plugin, use information inside the remote reader to identify the ticketing service to execute, execute the specified ticketing service using the remote reader and all of its others information, terminate the remote ticketing service using the Remote Plugin API by transmitting if needed personal information to the client.   Client side :  configure the factory and start the Local Service by providing the network implementation, register at least a local plugin to the smart card service and get the local reader to connect to the server, execute the remote service using the Local Service API by indicating the ticketing service id to execute and transmitting to the server if needed personal information or smart card content previously read.    ILLUSTRATION The following sequence diagram shows the capabilities of the plugin through an arbitrary example that illustrates :\n the initialization phase of the local and remote components ; the registration of the local plugin and observable reader ; the selection phase of an observable reader carried out directly by the client ; the sending of the selection result and additional information to the server to remotely perform a specific ticketing service (materialization, validation, etc\u0026hellip;) ; the reception by the server of the transmitted data ; the execution of the remote ticketing service ; the server subscription to observable reader events ; the sending of information to the client at the end of processing.  Note that the network layer is deliberately hide in this diagram. Its implementation is describe in the Network configuration chapter.\n  RemotePluginClient This plugin allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader).\n   API Client Server     Library Remote Lib Local Lib   Remote Plugin / Local Service RemotePluginClient LocalServiceServer   Factory RemotePluginClientFactory LocalServiceServerFactory   Utility RemotePluginClientUtils LocalServiceServerUtils    USE AND SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS  Server side :  configure the factory and start the Local Service by providing the network implementation, register at least a local plugin to the smart card service.   Client side :  configure the factory by providing the network implementation, register the Remote Plugin to the smart card service using the factory, use the Remote Plugin and its remote readers as a local plugin with local readers.    ObservableRemotePluginClient This plugin is a RemotePluginClient which also allows to observe the plugin events (such as reader connection, etc\u0026hellip;).\nPlease note that this mode is possible only if the local plugin is observable.\n   API Client Server     Library Remote Lib Local Lib   Remote Plugin / Local Service ObservableRemotePluginClient LocalServiceServer   Factory RemotePluginClientFactory LocalServiceServerFactory   Utility RemotePluginClientUtils LocalServiceServerUtils    USE AND SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS  Server side :  configure the factory and start the Local Service by providing the network implementation, register at least a local plugin to the smart card service.

In the class SelectionsResult (see processDefaultSelection/processExplicitSelection):\n  getActiveSelection is replaced by getActiveMatchingSe which returns an AbstractMatchingSe object (the still existing hasActiveSelection method must be used before)\n  getMatchingSelection is replaced by getMatchingSe which returns an AbstractMatchingSe object (may be null if the index provided does not correspond to a successful selection case)\n  getMatchingSelections now returns a Map containing a list of associated AbstractMatchingSe with the selection index that produced it (Map\u0026lt;Integer, AbstractMatchingSe\u0026gt;)\n  a new hasSelectionMatched method indicates whether the selection index provided corresponds to a successful selection case\n  a new getActiveSelectionIndex method returns the index of the active selection (the still existing hasActiveSelection method must be used before)\n  Definition of the security settings of the transaction These parameters are defined via the PoSecuritySettings class, whose construction now follows the Fluent Builder pattern.\nAll parameters are optional except the SamResource.\nHere is an example of a complete PoSecuritySettings build:\npoSecuritySettings = new PoSecuritySettings.PoSecuritySettingsBuilder(samResource) .sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_PERSO, DEFAULT_KIF_PERSO) .sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_LOAD, DEFAULT_KIF_LOAD) .sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_DEBIT, DEFAULT_KIF_DEBIT) .sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_PERSO, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_PERSO) .sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_LOAD, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_LOAD) .sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_DEBIT, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_DEBIT) .sessionModificationMode(ModificationMode.ATOMIC) .ratificationMode(RatificationMode.CLOSE_RATIFIED) .sessionAuthorizedKvcList(authKvcs) .build();  Creation of the PoTransaction object Since PoSecuritySettings now integrates SamResource, the construction of PoTransaction has evolved slightly.\nHere is an example:\nPoTransaction poTransaction = new PoTransaction(new PoResource(poReader, calypsoPo), poSecuritySettings);  Transaction commands preparation Just as with the \u0026ldquo;prepare\u0026rdquo; commands used for selection, the \u0026ldquo;prepare\u0026rdquo; commands used for transactions no longer return indexes.\nThe available commands in version 0.9 are:\npublic final void prepareSelectFile(SelectFileControl control) public final void prepareSelectFile(short lid) public final void prepareSelectFile(byte[] lid) public final void prepareReadRecordFile(byte sfi, int recordNumber) public final void prepareReadRecordFile(byte sfi, int firstRecordNumber, int numberOfRecords, int recordSize)) public final void prepareReadCounterFile(byte sfi, int countersNumber) public final void prepareUpdateRecord(byte sfi, int recordNumber, byte[] recordData) public final void prepareWriteRecord(byte sfi, int recordNumber, byte[] recordData) public final void prepareAppendRecord(byte sfi, byte[] recordData) public final void prepareIncreaseCounter(byte sfi, int counterNumber, int incValue) public final void prepareDecreaseCounter(byte sfi, int counterNumber, int decValue)  Transaction commands processing The \u0026ldquo;process\u0026rdquo; commands have also been revised and simplified.\nThey all return void.\nIn case of failure a exception is raised (see below).\npublic final void processOpening(PoTransaction.SessionSetting.AccessLevel accessLevel)  The ModificationMode is no longer required since it is integrated in the PoSecuritySettings.\nParameters previously used to specify that a file is read at login are removed.\nInstead, the first prepareReadFile command will be automatically taken into account.\npublic final void processPoCommands() public final void processPoCommandsInSession() public final void processCancel(ChannelControl channelControl) public final void processClosing(ChannelControl channelControl)  Retrieving data read from POs This is a major evolution of the Keyple API. Previously, data read from Calyspo POs were retrieved by applications using \u0026ldquo;parser\u0026rdquo; methods.\nWith Keyple API 0.9, Calypso PO data is made available in the CalypsoPo object obtained during selection and enriched all along the operations performed with PoTransaction.\nThe public getter methods of CalypsoPo are:\npublic final String getDfName() public final byte[] getDfNameBytes() public final String getApplicationSerialNumber() public final byte[] getApplicationSerialNumberBytes() public final String getAtr() public final String getStartupInfo() public final PoRevision getRevision() public final byte getSessionModification() public final byte getApplicationType() public final byte getApplicationSubtype() public final byte getPlatform() public final byte getSoftwareIssuer() public final byte getSoftwareVersion() public final byte getSoftwareRevision() public final boolean isDeselectRatificationSupported() public final boolean isConfidentialSessionModeSupported() public final boolean isPublicAuthenticationSupported() public final boolean isPinFeatureAvailable() public final boolean isSvFeatureAvailable() public final boolean isDfInvalidated() public final boolean isDfRatified() public final DirectoryHeader getDirectoryHeader() public final ElementaryFile getFileBySfi(byte sfi) public final ElementaryFile getFileByLid(short lid) public final Map\u0026lt;Byte, ElementaryFile\u0026gt; getAllFiles()  Four new classes DirectoryHeader, ElementaryFile, FileHeader and FileData have been added.\nDirectoryHeader The public getters for this class are:\npublic short getLid() public byte[] getAccessConditions() public byte[] getKeyIndexes() public byte getDfStatus() public byte getKif(AccessLevel level) public byte getKvc(AccessLevel level) public String toString()  ElementaryFile The public getters for this class are:\npublic byte getSfi() public FileHeader getHeader() public FileData getData() public String toString()  FileHeader The public getters for this class are:\npublic short getLid() public int getRecordsNumber() public int getRecordSize() public FileType getType() public byte getDfStatus() public boolean isShared() public Short getSharedReference() public byte[] getAccessConditions() public byte[] getKeyIndexes() public String toString()  FileData The public getters for this class are:\npublic byte[] getContent() public byte[] getContent(int numRecord) public byte[] getContent(int numRecord, int dataOffset, int dataLength) public SortedMap\u0026lt;Integer, byte[]\u0026gt; getAllRecordsContent() public int getContentAsCounterValue(int numCounter) public SortedMap\u0026lt;Integer, Integer\u0026gt; getAllCountersValue() public String toString()  So, for example to extract the contents of contract files present in the PO, the code might look like this:\n[...] /* Read all 4 contracts command, record size set to 29 */ poTransaction.prepareReadRecordFile(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_Contracts, CalypsoClassicInfo.RECORD_NUMBER_1, 4, 29); /* proceed with the sending of commands, don't close the channel */ poTransaction.processPoCommandsInSession(); ElementaryFile efContracts = calypsoPo.getFileBySfi(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_Contracts); SortedMap\u0026lt;Integer, byte[]\u0026gt; records = efContracts.getData().getAllRecordsContent(); for (Map.Entry\u0026lt;Integer, byte[]\u0026gt; entry : records.entrySet()) { logger.info(\u0026quot;Contract #{}: {}\u0026quot;, entry.getKey(), ByteArrayUtil.toHex(entry.getValue())); } [...]  Error handling Since version 0.9, all Keyple exceptions are of the RuntimeException type.\nCatching exceptions is therefore now optional.\nHowever, it is possible to selectively catch certain exceptions in order to deal with particular cases.\nThe new hierarchy of Keyple exceptions is shown here\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603811078,"objectID":"0c708f778edc51e07d87f819c4c14ced","permalink":"/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/migration-0.8.1-to-0.9.0/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/migration-0.8.1-to-0.9.0/","section":"docs","summary":"This guide is intended to help a user of version 0.8.1 of Keyple Java to upgrade his application to the 0.9.0 version of the library.\nFrom a user API point of view, the changes relate to the following topics:","tags":null,"title":"Migration Guide - Keyple Java 0.8.1 to 0.9.0","type":"book"},{"authors":["Calypso Networks Association"],"categories":["Events"],"content":"Are you a mobility aggregator, a system integrator, an event manager, a developer or a multi-mobility startup?
